File API - support readAsText(),readAsDataURl(),readAsArrayBuffer(), this works Chrome & Firefox 12,not works any IE yet
File Download API,this works only Chrome
Range Widget,this works only Chrome
color pick - not html5
----
I tested only Windows Chrome.if there are contributer I will support others.
but maybe official would support all platform.
